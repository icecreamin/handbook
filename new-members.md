# Welcome to UVic Virtual
We're glad to have you on the team! This page lays out the steps you can take to join the club, find a project and start creating in VR!

## Step 1: Join the slack
You should have gotten a sign up link in an email after you filled out your [introduction form](https://uvicvirtual.ca/#join-us). If not, please email [uvic.virtual@gmail.com](mailto:uvic.virtual@gmail.com) and we'll get you set up :smile: The slack is where you can find out about upcoming meetings, meet other people who are into VR and join projects.

## Step 2: Help people learn your name
To help everybody in the club learn your name, please upload a picture of yourself to the slack :bowtie:

## Step 3: Learn how we use Slack
We use Slack in a particular way to help make information easier to find. Check out our [Slack guidelines](slack.md) to see how you can help us stay clear.

## Step 4: Install Unity
City virtual uses version [2017.4.1f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2017.4). SoundstageVR uses version [5.5.5f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).

## Step 5: Join a project
Stay tuned to the Slack for project leads asking for help, upcoming meetings and VR lab training days!
