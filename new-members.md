# Welcome to UVic Virtual
We're glad to have you on the team! This page lays out the steps you can take to join the club, find a project and start creating in VR!

## Step 1: Join the slack
You should have gotten a sign up link in an email after you filled out your [introduction form](https://uvicvirtual.ca/#join-us). If not, please email [uvic.virtual@gmail.com](mailto:uvic.virtual@gmail.com) and we'll get you set up :smile: The slack is where you can find out about upcoming meetings, meet other people who are into VR and join projects.

## Step 2: Help people learn your name
To help everybody in the club learn your name, please upload a picture of yourself to the slack :bowtie:

## Step 3: Learn how we use Slack
We use Slack in a particular way to help make information easier to find. Check out our [Slack guidelines](slack.md) to see how you can help us stay clear.

## Step 4: Put your face in a headset :sunglasses:
Check our some of the [spots on campus](locations.md) where you can use VR!

## Step 5: Join a project (or start you own??)
Check out our [ongoing projects](projects.md) to see where you can jump in!
