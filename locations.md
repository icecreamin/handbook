# VR locations at UVic
We are fortunate to be able to use VR equipment at various locations around campus. The expectation is that if you are using one of these facilities on behalf of UVic Virtual, you will treat the equipment with utmost respect and be kind to every person you meet. Using this equipment is a privilege, and it's your responsibility to help us stay in good standing with our partners! :heart:
